The UR5 co-bot will be programmed to be able to play the interactive \& strategy-based game, checkers, against a human opponent. The robot will have an electropermanent magnetic attachment that will allow it to pick up and move the individual checkers pieces. The robot is not intended to beat the human opponent every time but rather just have the ability to play a full game of checkers against them. Our project aims to showcase the UR5 co-bot's abilities as a means of promoting the UT Arlington College of Engineering to prospective students through the means of an interactive demonstration.
