To ensure the robot arm can be reconfigured to execute our checkers-playing program, here are some additional requirements not covered in the previous sections. These requirements are important in case the customer would want to port our project to other platforms or would like to temporarily remove its modules to re-purpose the UR5 robot, and then reconfigure the robot to play checkers again in the future.
