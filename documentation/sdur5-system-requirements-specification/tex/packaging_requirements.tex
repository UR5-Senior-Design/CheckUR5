% Include a header paragraph here. Packaging requirements are those requirements that identify how the delivered product will be packaged for delivery to the end-user; or how it will "look" when finished and delivered. For example, you might specify that the software required for operation will be pre-loaded on the hard drive, delivered on CD/DVD, or available via download. Software might be customer installable, or not, etc. Hardware components could be all in a single package, provided as a "bag of parts" to be assembled/installed by the user, painted a certain color, logos affixed, etc. Care should be taken not to duplicate requirements found in other sections of this document.

This section covers the packaging requirements for the UR5 Checkers-Playing co-bot. The software components of the project will be consolidated through a GitHub repository, from which it can be downloaded and set up. The co-bot will be utilizing a CV Software package in conjunction with a camera for computer vision to perform tasks during the checkers game. Along with the robot arm, the product will include a checkers playing board, checkers pieces, and keyboard input to communicate the conclusion of a player's move to the robot.

\subsection{The product source code will be publicly available in a GitHub repository.}
\subsubsection{Description}
A link to the GitHub repository will be provided. As of now, the repository will contain a ReadMe file with instructions on setting up the robot arm.
