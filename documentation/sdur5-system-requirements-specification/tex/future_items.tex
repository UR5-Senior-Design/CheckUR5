%In this last section, you will reiterate all requirements that are listed as priority 5. This is repetitive, but necessary as a concise statement of features/functions that were considered/discussed and documented herein, but will NOT be addressed in the prototype version of the product due to constraints of budget, time, skills, technology, feasibility analysis, etc. Use the following format for this section.

This section covers the future requirements for the UR5 Checkers-Playing co-bot. These are the further developments that will be potentially made on the project which include but are not limited to having difficulty level setting, UR5 automatically resetting the board, and option to play other regional variations of the robot.

\subsection{The system shall have a difficulty level setting.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The user should be able to select an easier or a harder opponent to face. The difficulty of the opponent could be defined by how many moves ahead the system takes into account, or a particular algorithm.

\subsection{The system shall have the option to play other regional variations of checkers that use an 8x8 squares board.}
\subsubsection{Description}
Since there are many different variations of checkers played around the world (Russian draughts, Turkish draughts, etc.), there is a possibility to program the robot to play by slightly different rules.
