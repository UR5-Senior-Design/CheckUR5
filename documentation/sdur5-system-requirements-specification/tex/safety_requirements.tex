% Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Safety requirements might address items specific to your product such as: no exposure to toxic chemicals; lack of sharp edges that could harm a user; no breakable glass in the enclosure; no direct eye exposure to infrared/laser beams; packaging/grounding of electrical connections to avoid shock; etc.

This section covers the safety precautions surrounding the Checkers-Playing UR5 Co-bot. While working in the laboratory, the team will be following LOTO procedures and NEC wiring compliance. More specific to the robotic arm are standards related to having a designated area for any robotic manipulators, functions that automatically stop the movement of the robotic arm in the case of a collision, and a physical emergency stop button which also halts movement. 

\subsection{Laboratory equipment lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures}
\subsubsection{Description}
Any fabrication equipment provided used in the development of the project shall be used in accordance with OSHA standard LOTO procedures. Locks and tags are installed on all equipment items that present use hazards, and ONLY the course instructor or designated teaching assistants may remove a lock. All locks will be immediately replaced once the equipment is no longer in use.

CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Equipment usage, due to lock removal policies, will be limited to availability of the course instructor and designed teaching assistants.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Occupational Safety and Health Standards 1910.147 - The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout).
\subsubsection{Priority}
Critical

\subsection{National Electric Code (NEC) wiring compliance}
\subsubsection{Description}
Any electrical wiring must be completed in compliance with all requirements specified in the National Electric Code. This includes wire runs, insulation, grounding, enclosures, over-current protection, and all other specifications.

CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
High voltage power sources, as defined in NFPA 70, will be avoided as much as possible in order to minimize potential hazards.

\subsection{RIA robotic manipulator safety standards}
\subsubsection{Description}
Robotic manipulators, if used, will either housed in a compliant lockout cell with all required safety interlocks, or certified as a "collaborative" unit from the manufacturer.
\subsubsection{Source}
CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Collaborative robotic manipulators will be preferred over non-collaborative units in order to minimize potential hazards. Sourcing and use of any required safety interlock mechanisms will be the responsibility of the engineering team.
\subsubsection{Standards}

\subsection{The system shall stop upon collision.}
\subsubsection{Description}
When someone collides with the robot arm while it is in motion, the robot arm will automatically stop upon collision rather than continuing its motion. The system keeping track of the game state will also be paused, until explicitly told to resume.

\subsection{The system shall have an emergency stop.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The UR5 robotic arm has a controller which provides an emergency stop button to immediately stop all robot motion.
