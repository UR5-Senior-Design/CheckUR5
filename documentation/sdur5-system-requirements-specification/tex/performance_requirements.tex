%Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Performance requirements address items such as: how fast specific critical operations must complete; how long it takes to start/stop activities; how long the battery must last; maximum time it must take to set up; etc.

This section covers the performance requirements for the UR5 Checkers-Playing co-bot. This includes how the system will recognize the checkers pieces, recognize its magnetic gripper, complete its turn within a certain time, calculate certain moves ahead, how it will use frames from the webcam, and the way points setup for the robot.

\subsection{The system shall accurately recognize the checkers pieces.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robotic arm should be able to recognize the custom-made checkers pieces and be able to distinguish between its piece and player's piece to select and grip pieces that are within its domain.

\subsection{The UR5 robotic arm shall recognize when the magnetic gripper should be activated.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The robotic arm's magnetic gripper should only activate once it is its turn in the game, it has decided which piece should be moved, and it has decided on the end location on the checkers board.
