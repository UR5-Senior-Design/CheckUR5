% This is the "What" of the project and it states what will be done to address the problem statement. This section should focus mostly on what your solution is going to be and what it is going to do (i.e., we are going to build an app, robot, device, etc. to perform some task which mitigates the problem). If someone were to ask you \textit{"What are you doing for your senior design project?"}, this is section is basically what you would tell them.

Our project's objective is to program the UR5 co-bot to play checkers against a human opponent. We aim to accomplish this by utilizing computer vision to analyze the current state of the board so that the co-bot can then make an educated choice as to which move to play next. In order to pick up each individual piece we will create an accessory that we will attach to the UR5 arm so that the checkers pieces can either be picked up by vacuum suction or through electropermanent magnetism. The robot and the human player will take turns moving pieces until one of them wins.
