The approximate budget of the project is 800 USD which will be dedicated towards buying a camera, suction cup, magnets, and other materials for the chess board and game. The camera will be necessary for the sensors to detect player movements, the suction cup for the gripper will be used in picking and placing Checkers, the magnet will be needed for sticking the Checkers pieces in place, the Checkers board will be made of birch plywood which will be bought and painted, the paint will be bought and used for the Checkers board, and the Checkers pieces will be 3D printed at the UT Arlington FabLab with the NinjaFlex Filament as the primary material.
