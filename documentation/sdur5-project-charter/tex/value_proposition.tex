With the UR5 co-bot's ability to play a game of checkers against a human opponent, our customer, Dr. Christopher McMurrough, will be able to present the robot arm to students for marketing and educational purposes. This is possible because the robot arm is safe, flexible, and interactive. Collaborative demonstrations with the arm may garner students' interest in STEM and in the University of Texas at Arlington.

Lastly, any profit made from the project through demonstrations can open opportunities for involvement with charity and donations.
